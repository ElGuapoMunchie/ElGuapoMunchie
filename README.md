Hi, I’m Mark — a Computer Science graduate and incoming law student. My work combines a foundation in Java programming, machine learning, and problem-solving to create software that addresses real-world challenges. I’m especially interested in applying technical expertise to emerging issues in law and technology.

Two of my favorite projects that you should totally check out:
- [Softball App Showcase](https://github.com/ElGuapoMunchie/SoftballApp-Showcase)
- [Saul Goodman Inspired Website Design](https://github.com/ElGuapoMunchie/cs408-final-project)

I'm an avid student, so there may be more projects in the works soon. Solving problems is my passion, and I'm excited to see where it goes next!
